            <p className="py-6">Whether youâ€™re looking for a piece to complete a space or want to offload a room full of furniture before a big move, resale sites can often be your best bet for scoring something original or reaching lots of buyers with your listings. E-marketplaces can be competitive for both sellers and shoppers, but the good news is there are more resources than ever for getting into the re-commerce game, and each has its own special twist to offer users.
